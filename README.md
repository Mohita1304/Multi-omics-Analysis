**Highlights:**

 - Integration of multi-omics data to discover the colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers
 - Four genes were identified as prognostic biomarkers for survival prediction
 - Seven genes were identified for diagnosis and staging of CRC using machine learning
 - Gene expression and regulatory information used to calculate the regulatory strength
 - Calculated gene regulatory strength improved early vs. late-stage CRC prediction

**Datasets:**

All data analyzed in this study were sourced from publicly available databases:

 - Gene expression, somatic mutation, and copy number alteration data were obtained from [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/).   
 - Other datasets were downloaded from the [TCGA GDS portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) 
 - Gene expression datasets from [NCBI-GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
 
 **Codes:**

 In the repository, one can see two directories:

  - Python: For visualisation and machine learning experiments
  - R: Bioinformatics analysis (Differential expression, WGCNA, etc.)

**Libraries:**
 - Scikit-learn
 - R
